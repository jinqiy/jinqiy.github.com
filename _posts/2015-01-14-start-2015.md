What is coming in 2015?

After running one year, I am going to the second year as a runner. I hope before the end of this year, I can run a marathon, or at least a half marathon.  

I will keep post articles on this site. Like one or two posts every month. 

At least release one Android APP this year. I really want put it on market before July.

And the platforms I am looking after in good shape.

We will see, at the end of this year.
