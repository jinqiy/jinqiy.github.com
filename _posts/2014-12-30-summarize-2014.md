What happened in 2014?

I have began running on January, from walking the very beginning, now, I can running 5KM every other day, and 10KM each weekend, about 100KM monthly. And I will keep running in next year, maybe join one or two matches.

I create this web blog, and want this site could be lasted for more long time than other blogs of mine.

Also, I registered 2 domain names for running my Android APP. But, it is only a landing page by now.

About working, I have about 2 web applications under my control. They all are running smoothly, and support large concurrent users' access every day every hour. How many users? About 100 thousands.
