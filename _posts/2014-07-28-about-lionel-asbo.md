This article from [here](http://www.firstthings.com/web-exclusives/2012/12/a-review-of-martin-amiss-lionel-asbo-state-of-england), it is a review of the novel, Lionel Asbo : State of England of Martin Amiss.

As the reviewer said, this novel is about child. Here is what he said.

    I haven’t enjoyed a novel by Martin Amis so much since his 1995 work The Information . His newest book, Lionel Asbo: State of England , is as darkly comic as its predecessor with a similarly Odyssey-like plot. The protagonist has committed a crime”though in the case of the writer in The Information his crime was an ambiguously attempted infidelity and in Lionel Asbo , it is a real crime, or at least the breaking of a taboo”and then has to attempt to redeem himself. The novels also have in common a villain of epic proportions, a villain, in both cases, who is addicted to pornography and crime, and who was deprived of a decent childhood. And both books are also about the conception, birthing, raising, and protecting of children. 

    In The Information , the protagonist is a writer down on his luck in work and marriage. His two boys redeem his life in a way”at least he has had them!”and he saves them from being abducted at the end, which, he realizes, matters more than his writing or his marriage. It reminds me of the story about James Joyce, of how a friend of his was taken aback by Joyce’s delight in having another grandchild come into the world. When the friend protested that this was egotistical, Joyce said, “It’s the most important thing in the world.” The friend misunderstood Joyce as thinking it was important that another Joyce was in the world, but Joyce was talking about the begetting of children itself as more important than art”or anything else for that matter. 

    Amis revisits this theme in Lionel Asbo . Most of the novel is set in the fictional neighborhood of Diston, which is bursting with children, as no one seems to use, or know anything about, contraception, and not because they are devout Roman Catholics clutching copies of Humanae Vitae . Desmond Pepperdine, the novel’s protagonist, more often referred to as Des, is a mulatto whose grandmother Grace “was the mother of seven children by the age of nineteen.” Des commits the crime of letting himself be seduced at the age of fifteen by his thirty-nine-year-old, drunken grandmother. His own mother, Cilla, had died when he was twelve and he was taken in by his uncle Lionel since Des’s father, like almost all of the fathers in this novel, was never around. Once, Des and Cilla saw a black man passed out from drink on a park bench, and Cilla could not even get him to wake up. That was the only time that Des had seen his father. 

    Now Lionel, Grace’s youngest son, and Des’s uncle, is, as they say, a piece of work. “He was served his first restraining order when he was three,” the narrator tells us, and had his last name of Pepperdine changed to Asbo. The acronym “(as all the kingdom knew) stood for Anti-Social Behaviour Disorder.” Lionel tries to teach Des how to become a decent lawbreaking denizen of Diston and wonders why he doesn’t go out with the other boys to smash windows. “It’s not healthy,” Lionel laments; but Des has something else, or some one else on his mind:
